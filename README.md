http://www.4hairstyles.com has by far the largest collection of pictures of hairstyles online and its totally free! Plus we have a free 

hairstyle tester where you can try thousands of different hairstyles on a picture of yourself or a model again for free!

Advice:

There are well over 10 thousand examples of hairstyles in 65 different sections on this website. You would be very lucky 

indeed if every single one suited you. In the real world, different styles or colors or textures suit different face 

shapes, ages, ethnicities and personalities. We could go on about oval faces or square jaws and hair pulled on or off the 

face but the best way would be to see it for yourself. So we have created a utility for you to try a style on a picture of 

yourself or one of our models that looks similar with one of over a thousand different male and female styles.

To use our Hairstyle Tester utility with a photo of yourself simply take a passport style photograph of your face with 

your hair pulled back and flattened as much as possible. For best results either take the photo with a light, preferably 

white, background or use a graphics package like Paint® that comes free with all recent versions Windows® and cover and 

touch up the photo of you to remove a darker background or "trim" any excess hair that may stick out when you apply a new 

style.
